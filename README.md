```java

@SpringBootApplication
public class PizzaShopApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PizzaShopApplication.class, args);
    }

}

```

- **``customer``** contains data about all users who have registered in the application.

- **``product``** contains information about the current products that can be ordered.

- **``orders``** is needed to link data from the customer and product tables.

- **``cart``** processes data from the orders entity, displaying customer order amounts individually or by category.
